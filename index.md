By watching how you move, testing balance and reflexes, and tracking your response to care, we find the key restriction or imbalance. When the nervous system gets clearer signals, the body often does what it’s built to do — heal and stabilize."

Cranbury Chiropractic is your partner in pain relief, performance, and lifelong wellness. We combine time-tested chiropractic methods with modern tools and neurologic assessment to help you move better, recover faster, and stay active.

> “My style is neurologically based and I continually monitor how your nervous system is functioning and how it responds to the treatment that you received. Our nervous systems are incredibly complex and are self healing. If we can find the restriction or imbalance and address that, the body will usually heal itself.”

### What to Expect

- **First visit focus:** Your initial appointment centers on a thorough, accessible diagnosis. We take time to review your health history, discuss your goals, and perform a detailed assessment of movement, balance, and reflexes. You’ll receive a clear explanation of what’s driving your symptoms and a chance to ask questions in plain language.

- **Personalized treatment plan:** Every care plan is tailored to your needs, comfort, and lifestyle. We use evidence-based chiropractic adjustments, targeted soft-tissue therapy, neurologic drills, cold laser therapy (low-level laser), and simple, accessible exercises you can do at home. All interventions are explained and adapted for your preferences and abilities.

- **Ongoing progress tracking:** At each visit, we monitor your motion, pain levels, and functional improvements using both your feedback and objective measures. This ensures your care is effective, transparent, and responsive—so you always know what’s working and what comes next.
