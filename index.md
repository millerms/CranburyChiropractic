    excerpt: "We evaluate how your nervous system is communicating with your muscles and joints. By watching how you move, testing balance and reflexes, and tracking your response to care, we find the key restriction or imbalance. When the nervous system gets clearer signals, the body often does what it’s built to do — heal and stabilize."

Cranbury Chiropractic is your partner in pain relief, performance, and lifelong wellness. We combine time-tested chiropractic methods with modern tools and neurologic assessment to help you move better, recover faster, and stay active.

> “My style is neurologically based and I continually monitor how your nervous system is functioning and how it responds to the treatment that you received. Our nervous systems are incredibly complex and are self healing. If we can find the restriction or imbalance and address that, the body will usually heal itself.”  
> — **Dr. Paul Miller**

### What to Expect

- **First visit focus:** a clear diagnosis. We review your history, check movement, balance, and reflexes, and explain what’s driving your pain in plain language.
- **Treatment plan:** right‑sized care using adjustments, targeted soft‑tissue work, neurologic drills, Class IV laser, and simple exercises you can actually do.
- **Progress you can feel:** we track changes in motion, pain, and function each visit so you know what’s working.
