<div class="page__lead" markdown="1">
Welcome to Cranbury Chiropractic in Norwalk, CT. If you’re dealing with **back or neck pain**, **sciatica**, **headaches**, **balance concerns**, **dizziness**, or other mechanical pain, we’ll help you understand what’s going on and what to do next.

Our approach is practical and personalized: a thorough history and exam, **precise joint-specific adjustments**, a few **simple exercises** you can actually stick with, and modern tools like **Class III cold laser**, **Balance Tracker**, or **ESWT shockwave** when they’re a good fit.

You don’t need to “believe” in anything or memorize anatomy. We’ll explain the plan in plain language, track what’s improving, and adjust as we go—so you can move more confidently, sleep better, and get back to work, sports, and daily life.
</div>

<div class="reveal reveal--up" markdown="1">

**New here?** Most first visits follow a simple pattern: evaluate → treat → recheck progress. Care is focused and goal‑oriented—not open‑ended. If chiropractic isn’t the right fit after your evaluation, we’ll help point you toward the right next step.

</div>

**How we think about results:** Pain and movement are influenced by how your brain interprets input from joints, muscles, vision, and the inner ear. Our care aims to improve that signal—so motion feels easier, steadiness improves, and irritated tissues have a better chance to settle.

> “My care is guided by neurology. I closely monitor how your nervous system is functioning and how it changes with care. When we find the key restriction or imbalance and address it, the body often does what it’s designed to do - heal and stabilize.”

## What to Expect
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
**Step 1 — Evaluate:** We review your history and check movement, joint motion, posture/balance, and a few simple neurologic screens.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Step 2 — Find the key limitation:** We connect your symptoms to a clear driver (mobility, control/coordination, or tissue irritability) so care stays focused.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Step 3 — Make a right‑sized plan:** Care is designed to match your needs and goals—not to keep you coming forever. When helpful, we may use tools like laser or shockwave to support recovery.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Step 4 — Treat with comfort in mind:** Visits are concise, and you’re always in control.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Step 5 — Track and adjust:** We recheck simple measures (range, function, steadiness) to confirm what’s helping.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Step 6 — Refer when appropriate:** If chiropractic isn’t the best next step, we’ll point you to the right provider.
