> “My care is guided by neurology. I closely monitor how your nervous system is functioning and how it changes with care. When we find the key restriction or imbalance and address it, the body often does what it’s designed to do - heal and stabilize.”

## What to Expect

- **Evaluate:** Short, focused screens to find the *limiter* (what’s holding you back). We review your history, check movement/coordination, and use tools like a balance tracker when helpful.
- **Plan:** Right‑sized care matched to your goals — targeted drills, adjustments or manual work when appropriate, and simple home exercises you’ll actually do.
- **Treat:** Precise, gentle techniques; add‑ons like Class III cold laser or shockwave when appropriate. We explain each step and adapt to your comfort.
- **Track:** Quick rechecks so you can feel and see progress. We adjust the plan based on what works for you.
