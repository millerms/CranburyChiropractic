Welcome to Cranbury Chiropractic — care tailored to you. If you’re dealing with **back, neck, joint, or balance concerns**, we use a neurologic approach in everything we do: precise adjustments, simple targeted drills, and modern tools (Class III cold laser and shockwave) so changes stick and you can move confidently, sleep better, and get back to work or sport.
</div>


> “My care is guided by neurology. I closely monitor how your nervous system is functioning and how it changes with care. When we find the key restriction or imbalance and address it, the body often does what it’s designed to do - heal and stabilize.”

## What to Expect

**First visit:** We start with a quick screen to find your key limiter (balance, range of motion, or strength). Then we evaluate how you move and feel, looking at how different areas influence each other. We gather your history and goals to build a right-sized plan that fits your life. We use different tools to gather data, like functional tests, x-rays, or computerized balance tests, depending on your needs.
