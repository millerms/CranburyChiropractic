<div class="page__lead" markdown="1">
Welcome to Cranbury Chiropractic in Norwalk, CT. If you’re dealing with **lower back or neck pain**, **sciatica**, **headaches**, **balance concerns**, or other mechanical pain, we take a practical, neurologic approach: precise adjustments, short targeted exercises, and modern tools like Class III cold laser and ESWT shockwave when they’re a good fit. 

The goal is steady, meaningful change so you can move confidently, sleep better, and get back to work or sport. We care for people of all ages; many of our patients are seniors.

> “My care is guided by neurology. I closely monitor how your nervous system is functioning and how it changes with care. When we find the key restriction or imbalance and address it, the body often does what it’s designed to do - heal and stabilize.”  
> ~ **Dr. Paul Miller**

## What to Expect
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
**Evaluate:** We review your history and check key systems—movement, joint motion, balance, and simple neurologic screens—so we understand what’s limiting you.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Map the limiter:** We connect findings to a clear limiter (e.g., mobility, control, or tissue irritability) so care is focused and practical.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Plan:** We build a right‑sized plan—adjustments, simple exercises, and add‑ons like laser or shockwave when useful. We explain why each step helps.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Treat:** Visits are concise and matched to your comfort. You’re always in control.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Track:** We recheck simple measures (range, function, steadiness) to confirm what’s helping and adjust as you go.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Referral:** If chiropractic isn’t the right fit after your initial evaluation, we’ll connect you with the appropriate provider.
