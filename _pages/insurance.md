## Using Your Benefits — What to Ask Your Plan
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
- **Deductible** remaining for the year
- **Copay** or **coinsurance** for chiropractic services

## Out‑of‑Network & Self‑Pay
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
If your plan isn’t in‑network or you prefer not to use insurance, we offer straightforward self‑pay options. We can provide an **itemized receipt (superbill)** you can submit to your plan for possible reimbursement. **HSA/FSA** cards are welcome.

## Pricing Overview
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
We keep costs transparent and explain them in advance. Typical structure:
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

- **First visit** — Consultation, targeted exam, and treatment when appropriate.
- **Follow‑up visits** — Shorter, focused sessions to reinforce progress.
- **Adjunct options** — Class III cold laser and/or shockwave (ESWT) when they’re a good fit.

> Coverage for exams and adjunct therapies varies by plan (for example, Medicare generally covers spinal manipulation but not exams or adjunct therapies). We’ll review your options before care.

## FAQs

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Do you verify my benefits?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes — we check benefits as a <strong>courtesy</strong> so you have a clear estimate. Final responsibility rests with the member, so we also recommend calling the number on your card for the most accurate details.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Do I need a referral?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Most plans don’t require a referral for chiropractic, but some do. If your plan lists a PCP gatekeeper or requires pre‑authorization, please confirm with your insurer.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How does Medicare work?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Medicare typically covers chiropractic <strong>spinal manipulation</strong> when medically necessary. <strong>Exams and adjunct therapies</strong> (e.g., laser, shockwave, therapeutic exercise) are generally <strong>not covered</strong> by Medicare and may be self‑pay. A Medicare supplement/secondary plan may help with some costs. We’ll explain your options before care.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Can I use HSA/FSA?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes. We accept HSA/FSA cards and can provide itemized receipts for your records.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What if I’m out‑of‑network?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      You can self‑pay and we’ll provide a <strong>superbill</strong> you can submit to your plan. Many patients receive partial reimbursement depending on their out‑of‑network benefits.
