## What to Expect on Your First Visit
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

Your first visit typically lasts about 45 minutes. We usually run on time, so if you arrive 10-15 minutes early you shouldn’t have to wait.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

We start by identifying the underlying **cause**—the mobility, control, or tissue-irritability pattern most holding you back. The exam follows the **sensory → brain → motor** loop: we test how your sensory systems (spine and other joints, eyes, and inner ears) talk to your brain, update that map with precise input, and reinforce motor output so movement, comfort, steadiness, and even muscle and blood-vessel tone improve.

## What to Expect
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
**Evaluate:** We thoroughly review your history and check key systems—movement, joint motion, balance, and simple neurologic screens for proprioception, eyes, and inner ears.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Map the cause:** We connect findings to the cause (mobility, control, or tissue irritability) so care stays focused and practical.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Plan:** We build a right‑sized plan—adjustments, simple exercises, and add‑ons like laser or shockwave when useful. We explain why each step helps.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Treat:** Visits are concise and matched to your comfort. You’re always in control.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Track:** We recheck simple measures (range, function, steadiness) to confirm what’s helping and adjust as you go.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

**Referral:** If chiropractic isn’t the right fit after your initial evaluation, we’ll refer you to an appropriate provider.

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Movement & Chiropractic Assessment</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Posture and movement checks, joint motion (palpation), and how different areas influence each other (e.g., hip → low back). We look for the clearest place to create change.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Neurologic Exam</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Thorough neurologic exam including eye movements and head/eye coordination, simple balance tests (eyes open/closed, single‑leg stance), reflexes, and strength checks. We’re mapping input → output.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Orthopedic Exam</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Orthopedic checks including range‑of‑motion and position tests that help confirm or rule out common disc, joint, and tendon issues. Always scaled to comfort.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Balance Tracker (risk‑of‑fall score)</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      A computerized force plate measures sway while you stand still. It gives an easy‑to‑understand score you can track over time.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Imaging (only if indicated)</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">

## Follow‑Up Visits
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
Follow‑ups are typically shorter than the first visit. We recheck key measures, treat what’s most relevant that day, and adjust your at‑home plan so changes stick. Frequency depends on your goals, findings, and response to care.
