## What to Expect on Your First Visit
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

We start by finding your **limiter**—the thing most likely holding back your movement or comfort. Then we build a right‑sized plan to match it.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

1. **Conversation & history** — We listen to your story and goals. What matters to you guides the plan.  
2. **Targeted screen** — Short checks to see where to focus: balance, range of motion, control, or tissue irritability.  
3. **Exam** — Based on what we find, we’ll use the most relevant tests (see examples below).  
4. **Plain‑language summary** — What we think is going on and why.  
5. **First treatment (when appropriate)** — Usually a combination of precise adjustments, soft‑tissue work, and simple drills. Tools like **Class III cold laser** or **shockwave (ESWT)** may be used when they’re a good fit.  
6. **Home plan** — Brief “micro‑sets” you can actually fit into your day.  
7. **Next steps** — How often to check in and what progress should look like.

## Examples of Tests We May Use
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Movement & Chiropractic Assessment</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Posture and movement checks, joint motion (palpation), and how different areas influence each other (e.g., hip → low back). We look for the clearest place to create change.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Neurologic Screen</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Eye movements and head/eye coordination, simple balance tests (eyes open/closed, single‑leg stance), reflexes, and light strength checks. We’re mapping input → output.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Orthopedic Checks</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Range‑of‑motion and position tests that help confirm or rule out common joint/tendon issues. Always scaled to comfort.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Balance Tracker (risk‑of‑fall score)</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      A computerized force plate measures sway while you stand still. It gives an easy‑to‑understand score you can track over time.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary><strong>Imaging (only if indicated)</strong></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      X‑rays or other imaging are ordered only when they’re likely to change the plan. We avoid unnecessary imaging.
    </div>
  </details>
</div>

## Follow‑Up Visits
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
Follow‑ups are typically shorter than the first visit. We recheck key measures, treat what’s most relevant that day, and adjust your at‑home plan so changes stick. Frequency depends on your goals, findings, and response to care.
