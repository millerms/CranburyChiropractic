Dr. Miller helps people with back, neck, and joint problems get moving again. His care is guided by a **neurologic lens** and built around practical steps: precise, hands‑on adjustments; simple drills you can actually do; and modern tools like **Class III cold laser** and **shockwave** when appropriate. Plans are **right‑sized** to your goals and schedule, and progress is measured at each visit so you know what’s helping.

> "In my early twenties, after too many miles on the road, my lower back gave out. A friend suggested chiropractic care. I was skeptical at first, and I didn’t want painkillers or surgery, so I had nothing to lose. I booked an appointment and saw Dr. Ernie Landi. I could barely stand up straight when I arrived; after a few adjustments I was comfortable and upright again. He helped me heal and became a mentor. I’d been interested in healthcare, but hadn’t found a path that fit my beliefs. Chiropractic changed that and my new career began."

### Philosophy & Approach
- **Neurologic approach:** we look at how your eyes, inner ear, spine, and joints are communicating with the brain, then target the system that’s holding you back.
- **Precise adjustments:** diversified technique for the spine **and** extremities (ankle, knee, shoulder, wrist) when it’s the right fit.
- **Active care:** brief, practical drills (balance, gaze/head coordination, mobility/activation) so improvements last.
- **Modern tools when useful:** Class III cold laser (photobiomodulation) and ESWT **shockwave** for select conditions.
- **Measure & adapt:** short re‑checks each visit to confirm what’s working and adjust the plan.

### Areas of Focus
- Back and neck pain; tension‑type headaches associated with neck issues
- Hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, and wrist problems related to mobility or control
- Balance and stability concerns that benefit from a musculoskeletal/neurologic lens
- Post‑injury return to activity when it’s safe to progress
- “Doesn’t feel normal yet” complaints after basic rehab

### Outside the Clinic
When he’s not in the office, Dr. Miller is usually in motion or outside. He’s an avid mountain biker, skier, and keeps his legs fresh with indoor spin sessions. At home, he tends a few beehives and helps his wife, Pat, in the garden. They raised two sons, Alex and Mike, and enjoy spending time with their family. He also loves to travel, explore new trails, and bring back ideas that keep the clinic fresh.
