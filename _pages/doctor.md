Dr. Miller helps people with back, neck, and joint pain return to the activities they enjoy. His care is guided by a neurologically informed approach and built around practical steps: precise, hands‑on adjustments; simple exercises you can actually do; and, when helpful, modern tools like the Balance Tracking System (a computerized steadiness score), low‑level (Class III) laser, and shockwave therapy. Every plan traces the same loop—clarify sensory input, help the brain update its model, then reinforce motor output so movement and even blood vessel tone respond with less effort. After we identify the underlying cause—the mobility, control, or tissue‑irritability pattern most holding you back—you’ll choose a right‑sized plan that fits your goals and schedule, and we’ll measure progress so you can see what’s helping.

> "In my early twenties, after too many miles on the road, my lower back gave out. A friend suggested chiropractic care. I was skeptical at first, and I didn’t want painkillers or surgery, so I had nothing to lose. I booked an appointment and saw Dr. Ernie Landi. I could barely stand up straight when I arrived; after a few adjustments I was comfortable and upright again. He helped me heal and became a mentor. I’d been interested in healthcare, but hadn’t found a path that fit my beliefs. Chiropractic changed that and my new career began."

### Philosophy & Approach
- **Neurologically informed:** check how your spine, joints, muscles, eyes, and inner ear communicate with the brain, then target what’s most limiting you.
- **Precise adjustments:** diversified technique for the spine and extremities when it’s the right fit.
- **Active care:** brief, practical exercises so improvements last.
- **Modern tools when useful:** Balance Tracking System, low‑level (Class III) laser, and ESWT shockwave for stubborn areas.
- **Measure & adapt:** short re‑checks to confirm what’s working and adjust the plan together.
