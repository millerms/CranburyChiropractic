## Our Approach to Care
At Cranbury Chiropractic, care is **tailored to you**—not a one-size-fits-all routine. We use a **neurologic approach** as our lens for every plan, looking at how your brain and body communicate (sensory input → motor output). That means we consider the **visual** (eyes), **vestibular** (inner ear), and **proprioceptive** (joints & muscles) systems, alongside joint motion, soft tissue, breathing, and how you move in daily life.

We keep it practical, explain each step, and build a plan that fits your goals and schedule.

## How Your Visit Works
- **Screen** — Quick tests to find your limiter: balance, range of motion, or strength.
- **Evaluate** — We assess your movement, comfort, and how different areas influence each other.
- **Plan** — A right-sized plan that fits your life, whether it’s adjustments, exercise, laser therapy, or shockwave therapy.
- **Educate** — We explain each step and why it matters, so you understand how it fits your goals.
- **Empower** — You’ll get clear, practical homework that fits your schedule—no long workouts or complex drills.
- **Treat** — Precise, gentle techniques; add-ons like laser or shockwave when appropriate.
- **Track** — We measure progress with functional tasks, comfort changes, and tissue tolerance.
- **Reassess** — Quick rechecks to confirm what’s helping and adjust as needed.
