## Our Approach to Care

At Cranbury Chiropractic, every treatment plan is tailored to you — not a cookie-cutter routine. We combine time‑tested chiropractic methods with modern tools and neurologic assessment to help you move better, recover faster, and stay active.

### Neurologic Approach

Your nervous system is the communication network between your brain and body. When signals are clear, muscles, joints, and tissues work together smoothly. When those signals are interrupted or altered, pain, stiffness, or instability can follow.

Dr. Paul Miller uses a neurologic approach to:
- Evaluate how your nervous system is communicating with muscles and joints
- Check balance, reflexes, and movement patterns
- Monitor how you respond during and after care

By finding and addressing the key restriction or imbalance, we help restore clear signaling so your body can do what it’s designed to do — heal itself.

### Diversified Technique

The Diversified Technique is one of the most widely used hands‑on chiropractic methods. It focuses on restoring normal movement in joints that aren’t moving as they should.

What to expect:
- Careful assessment to identify the specific joints that need adjusting
- Gentle positioning and a quick, controlled thrust to restore motion
- A “popping” sound may occur — this is simply gas being released from the joint space, not bones grinding
- Many patients notice immediate improvements in mobility and comfort

This technique is highly adaptable, allowing Dr. Miller to tailor each adjustment to your needs and comfort level.

### Cold Laser Therapy (Low-Level Laser Therapy)

Cold laser therapy, also known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), uses gentle, non-heating light energy to stimulate cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. This non-invasive treatment is safe, comfortable, and suitable for a wide range of musculoskeletal and nerve-related conditions. Our technology allows for precise targeting of affected tissues to support faster recovery and improved function, all without medication or surgery.

Common benefits include:
- Reduced swelling and inflammation
- Accelerated tissue healing and repair
- Relief from both acute and chronic pain

### Balance and Posture Testing

Good balance and posture aren’t just for athletes — they’re essential for everyone. We assess your stability and alignment to find imbalances that may be contributing to pain or risk of injury.

This may include:
- Postural analysis
- Balance and coordination tests
- Corrective strategies and exercises
