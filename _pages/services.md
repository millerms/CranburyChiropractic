## Our Approach to Care
At Cranbury Chiropractic, care is **tailored to you**—not a one-size-fits-all routine. We use a **neurologic approach** as our lens for every plan, looking at how your brain and body communicate (sensory input → motor output). That means we consider the **visual** (eyes), **vestibular** (inner ear), and **proprioceptive** (joints & muscles) systems, alongside joint motion, soft tissue, breathing, and how you move in daily life.

We keep it practical, explain each step, and build a plan that fits your goals and schedule.

## How Your Visit Works
- **Evaluate** — Short, focused screens to find the *limiter* (what’s holding you back).  
- **Plan** — Right-sized care: targeted drills, adjustments or manual work when helpful, simple exercises you’ll actually do.  
- **Treat** — Precise, gentle techniques; add-ons like laser or shockwave when appropriate.  
- **Track** — Quick rechecks so you can feel and see progress.

> Results vary. If we think another specialist is a better first step, we’ll say so and help coordinate care.
