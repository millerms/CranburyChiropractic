## Our Approach to Care
At Cranbury Chiropractic, care is **tailored to you**—not a one-size-fits-all routine. We use a **neurologic approach** as our lens for every plan, looking at how your brain and body communicate (sensory input → motor output). That means we consider the **visual** (eyes), **vestibular** (inner ear), and **proprioceptive** (joints & muscles) systems, alongside joint motion, soft tissue, breathing, and how you move in daily life.

We keep it practical, explain each step, and build a plan that fits your goals and schedule.

## How Your Visit Works
- **Listen & history** — your goals and story guide the plan.
- **Targeted screen** — quick checks to map the **limiter** (balance, range, control, or tissue irritability).
- **Evaluate** — how input (eyes, inner ear, joints) connects to output (coordination, strength, confidence).
- **Plan** — a right‑sized mix of adjustments and simple drills; when helpful we add **Class III cold laser** or **ESWT**.
- **Treat** — precise, comfortable techniques matched to your preferences.
- **Home micro‑sets** — brief exercises you can actually do.
- **Track & reassess** — quick rechecks so you know what’s working.

## Not sure where to start?
- Start with the **Neurologic Approach** to see how we map your limiter and shape care.
- If steadiness is the main concern, go to **Balance & Stability**. If you’re after joint work, see **Full‑Spine & Extremities**.
- For persistent tendon/fascia spots, compare **Shockwave (ESWT)** and **Cold Laser (Class III)**—we’ll help you choose what fits your case and goals.
