A quick guide to the most common issues we see — and how we match care to your goals. If you don’t see your exact situation, reach out. We’ll let you know if it’s a fit or help you find the right place.

## How we match care to your case
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
- **Neurologic lens:** we’ll check how your brain and body communicate (proprioceptive, visual, vestibular) and target the cause—the mobility, control, or tissue-irritability pattern most holding you back.
- **Precise joint care:** full‑spine and extremity adjustments when appropriate—never one‑size‑fits‑all.
- **Practical exercises:** short “micro‑sets” you can actually do.
- **Modern tools:** **Class III cold laser** and **shockwave (ESWT)** when they’re a good fit.
- **Progress you can feel:** quick rechecks so you know what’s helping.

At every visit we roll through the same sensory → brain → motor loop: test how joints/muscles, eyes, inner ear, and skin are talking to your brain, restore clearer input, then reinforce motor output so motion, steadiness, and circulation respond with less effort.

    <summary><span class="term">Dizziness &amp; Sensory Mismatch</span><span class="desc">“off balance,” lightheaded when turning, motion sensitivity</span></summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Examples: dizziness when you turn quickly, feeling “wobbly” on uneven ground or stairs, or motion sensitivity in cars or crowds.
      <br><br>
      <em>Why it helps:</em> Adjustments and targeted neurologic drills resync how neck proprioceptors, vision, and inner ear talk to your brain so motor output (movement and vessel tone) stabilizes.
      <br><br>
      <em>What often helps:</em>

## When we refer or co‑manage
{: .reveal .reveal--up }
If we think another provider is a better first step (e.g., imaging, medication, specialty vestibular therapy, orthopedic or neurologic evaluation), we’ll tell you and help coordinate care. Your safety and best outcome always come first.
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

> **Emergencies:** If you are experiencing chest pain, severe shortness of breath, sudden severe headache, new neurological deficits (face droop, trouble speaking, one‑sided weakness), major trauma, fever with severe back pain — please seek emergency care immediately.
