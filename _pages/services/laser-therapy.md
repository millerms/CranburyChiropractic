## Overview
Class III “cold” laser uses specific light to support your body’s recovery. It may help calm irritation and support tissue healing—used on its own or alongside adjustments and exercise. It’s called “cold” because treatment is non‑thermal and usually feels comfortable.

### How it works
Cold laser (photobiomodulation) is absorbed by cells and can influence mitochondrial energy (ATP), local circulation, and chemical messengers involved in healing. Treatments are non‑invasive and comfortable; we use protective eyewear.

### When we use it
- Irritated joints or soft tissues after overuse/sprains/strains  
- Tendon complaints (e.g., achilles, rotator cuff, elbow)  
- Plantar fascia or other persistent sore spots  
- As an add-on to your active care plan

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** – confirm cold laser is appropriate for you  
2. **Treatment** – typically **5–15 minutes**; usually no heat (sometimes mild warmth)  
3. **No downtime** – you can resume your day  
4. **Series** – some people benefit from several sessions

### How we measure progress
- Comfort during activities and daily tasks  
- Range-of-motion and functional milestones  
- Your own report of “how it feels” over time

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is there research to support it?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes. A few examples:
      <ul>
        <li>Chow RT et al. Low‑level laser therapy for neck pain — systematic review/meta‑analysis of randomized trials. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19913903/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PubMed 19913903</a></li>

    <summary>Why Class III ("cold") and not Class IV?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <ul>
        <li>Outcomes depend on the right <strong>dose</strong> (wavelength, energy, and time), not just the device class.</li>
        <li>Class III is <strong>non‑thermal and comfortable</strong>, and pairs well with adjustments and exercises.</li>
        <li>Class IV can deliver dose faster, but it’s <strong>not inherently more effective</strong>; we focus on delivering the right dose safely.</li>
