### Overview
Class III (low‑level, “cold”) laser therapy uses focused light energy (**photobiomodulation**) to support your body’s natural processes. In many people it may help **calm irritation**, **modulate inflammation**, and **support tissue recovery**—used on its own or alongside adjustments and exercise. It’s called “cold” because treatment is non‑thermal and usually doesn’t feel hot.

### How it works
Low‑level laser light is absorbed by cells and can influence mitochondrial activity (ATP production), local circulation, and chemical messengers involved in irritation and healing. Treatments are non‑invasive and comfortable; we use protective eyewear.

### When it may help
- Irritated joints or soft tissues after overuse/sprains/strains  
- Tendon complaints (e.g., achilles, rotator cuff, elbow)  
- Plantar fascia or other persistent sore spots  
- As an add-on to your active care plan

2. **Treatment** – typically **5–15 minutes**; usually no heat (sometimes mild warmth)  
3. **No downtime** – you can resume your day  
4. **Series** – some people benefit from several sessions
