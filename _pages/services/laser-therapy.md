### Overview
Class IV laser therapy uses focused light energy (**photobiomodulation**) to support your body’s natural processes. In many people it can help **calm irritation**, **modulate inflammation**, and **support tissue recovery**—used on its own or alongside adjustments and exercise.

### How it works (plain English)
Laser light is absorbed by cells and can increase cellular energy (ATP), improve micro-circulation, and influence chemical messengers involved in irritation and healing. Class IV devices allow **shorter sessions** and **deeper reach** than earlier classes. Treatments are non-invasive and comfortable.

### When it may help
- Irritated joints or soft tissues after overuse/sprains/strains  
- Tendon complaints (e.g., achilles, rotator cuff, elbow)  
- Plantar fascia or other persistent sore spots  
- As an add-on to your active care plan

### What to expect
1. **Quick screen** – confirm laser is appropriate for you  
2. **Treatment** – usually under 10 minutes; you may feel gentle warmth  
3. **No downtime** – you can resume your day  
4. **Series** – some people benefit from several sessions

### How we measure progress
- Comfort during activities and daily tasks  
- Range-of-motion and functional milestones  
- Your own report of “how it feels” over time

> We’ll tell you if laser isn’t the right match or if another service is a better first step.
