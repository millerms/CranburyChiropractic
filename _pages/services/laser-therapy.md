## Overview
Class III “cold” laser uses specific light to support your body’s recovery. We use it **selectively**—mainly for irritable tendon or fascia problems—and almost always **alongside an active plan** (adjustments, simple drills, and loading) so improvements carry over into daily life. It’s called “cold” because treatment is non‑thermal and usually feels comfortable.

### How it works
Cold laser (photobiomodulation) is absorbed by cells and can influence **mitochondrial energy (ATP)**, **local circulation**, and **pain‑modulating signals**. Dosing (wavelength, energy, time, and target depth) matters more than device marketing. Treatments are non‑invasive.

### When we use it
- **Plantar fascia** irritation or heel pain
- **Tendinopathy** (e.g., Achilles, patellar, rotator cuff, lateral elbow) when tissues are sore and loading alone isn’t enough
- **Post‑overuse** soft‑tissue irritability to help you resume activity
- As a comfort‑focused **adjunct** to an active care plan

### When we don’t
Cold laser isn’t a cure‑all. For example, it hasn’t shown meaningful benefit for **non‑specific low‑back pain** in higher‑quality reviews. We’ll tell you when another approach is a better first step.

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** — confirm cold laser fits your goals and findings  
2. **Treatment** — typically **5–15 minutes**; most feel little to no sensation (sometimes mild warmth)  
3. **Series** — many people benefit from a short series (**3–6 sessions**)  
4. **No downtime** — you can resume your day; we’ll pair it with simple drills  
5. **Track** — quick rechecks guide any adjustments to the plan

### How we measure progress
- Comfort during activities and daily tasks  
- Range‑of‑motion and functional milestones  
- Your own report of “how it feels” over time

### FAQs

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is it safe?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes, Class III lasers are generally safe when used appropriately. They’re non‑thermal and most people feel little to no sensation during treatment. We avoid use over the eyes and follow standard safety guidelines.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is there research to support it?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes—especially for some tendon and plantar‑fascia problems when dosing is appropriate and care is paired with exercise. Results are <strong>mixed</strong> in other areas and <strong>not supportive</strong> for non‑specific low‑back pain. Representative sources:

    That's why we use cold laser selectively, as an adjunct to an active plan.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Why Class III ("cold") and not Class IV?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Device <em>class</em> refers mainly to power/eye‑safety categories. Outcomes depend on the delivered <strong>dose</strong> at the tissue (wavelength, energy, time, target depth), not class alone. Class IV units can deliver dose faster and feel warmer; Class III is comfortable and gives us fine control. We focus on safe, effective dosing matched to your case.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Will I feel anything?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Most people feel little to no sensation. Some notice mild warmth.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How many sessions will I need?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      It varies by condition, but many benefit from a short series (often <strong>3–6 sessions</strong>). We reassess and adjust as needed.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Can I combine it with other care?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes. We typically pair cold laser with adjustments, targeted drills, and a simple loading plan so changes last.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What if I need another provider?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      We’ll coordinate with the right specialist if needed (PT, orthopedics, etc.). The goal is the best result for you.
