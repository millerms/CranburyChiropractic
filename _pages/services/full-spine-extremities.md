### Why adjustments may help
Joints—and the muscles and tendons around them—are packed with proprioceptors that feed your central nervous system and helps your body understand where it is in space. Cleaner input lets your brain send more accurate motor output to muscles and even modulates blood-vessel tone. Better coordination, smoother movement, and more comfortable motion follow. We walk you through every step and only adjust when it fits your needs.

### When we use it
- Discomfort or pain that isn’t resolving
- Stiffness or tightness that limits **range of motion**  
- Feeling "off" or "off-balance"
- Returning to activity after injury (once it’s safe)

### What to expect
1. **Examine & explain** — thorough history, orthopedic, neurologic, and chiropractic exams; we discuss options and answer questions  
2. **Setup** — comfortable positioning and clear instructions so you know what to expect  
3. **Adjustment** — a quick, small-amplitude thrust to a specific joint; a pop may or may not occur  
4. **Recheck** — confirm changes in motion and comfort, and plan next steps

### How we measure progress
- Range-of-motion and functional tasks (squat, step-down, overhead reach)  
- Decreases in pain and discomfort during daily activities and exercise  
- Strength/coordination changes with simple tests

      The “pop” is a quick release of gas bubbles in the joint fluid, not bones cracking. It’s normal and often feels good, but not everyone experiences it.
