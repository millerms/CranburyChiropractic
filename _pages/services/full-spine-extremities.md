## Overview
Stiff or “stuck” joints—spine or extremities—can change how you move and feel. We assess the whole system and, when it fits your goals, use precise, hands‑on adjustments for both spine and limbs.

### Why adjustments may help
Joints are packed with position receptors that talk to your nervous system; clearer input commonly translates to smoother, easier movement. We explain each step and only adjust when it fits your goals.

### When we use it
- Stiffness/tightness that limits **range of motion**  
- Discomfort that isn’t resolving with exercise alone  
- Returning to activity after sprains/strains (once it’s safe)  
- Feeling “off” with squats, steps, overhead reach, or grip

### What to expect
1. **Movement & joint screen** – we look at motion, comfort, and how areas influence each other  
2. **Adjustment (if appropriate)** – gentle positioning and a quick, controlled thrust  
3. **Add-ons as needed** – soft-tissue work or simple activation/mobility exercises  
4. **Home plan** – focused exercises to keep gains between visits  
5. **Rechecks** – confirm progress and adjust the plan

### How we measure progress
- Range-of-motion and functional tasks (squat, step-down, overhead reach)  
- Comfort during daily activities and exercise  
- Strength/coordination changes with simple tests

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What’s the “pop”?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      The “pop” is a quick release of gas bubbles in the joint fluid, not bones cracking. It’s normal and often feels good, but not everyone experiences it.
