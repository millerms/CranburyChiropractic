### Overview
Chiropractic care isn’t just for the spine. Joints in the **ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, and wrists** can limit movement and change how you feel. We assess the whole system and, when appropriate, use precise, hands-on adjustments for both spine **and** extremities.

### Why adjustments may help
Joints are packed with sensors (mechanoreceptors) that tell your brain how a joint is moving. When motion is restricted, those signals get “noisy,” which can feel like stiffness or discomfort. A gentle, quick adjustment can restore motion and often improves how your brain and muscles coordinate. We explain each step and only adjust when it fits your goals.

### When it may help
- Stiffness/tightness that limits **range of motion**  
- Discomfort that isn’t resolving with exercise alone  
- Returning to activity after sprains/strains (once it’s safe)  
- Feeling “off” with squats, steps, overhead reach, or grip

### What to expect
1. **Movement & joint screen** – we look at motion, comfort, and how areas influence each other  
2. **Adjustment (if appropriate)** – gentle positioning and a quick, controlled thrust  
3. **Add-ons as needed** – soft-tissue work or simple activation/mobility exercises  
4. **Home plan** – focused drills to keep gains between visits  
5. **Rechecks** – confirm progress and adjust the plan

### How we measure progress
- Range-of-motion and functional tasks (squat, step-down, overhead reach)  
- Comfort during daily activities and exercise  
- Strength/coordination changes with simple tests

    <summary>What’s the “pop”?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      The “pop” is a quick release of gas bubbles in the joint fluid, not bones cracking. It’s normal and often feels good, but not everyone experiences it.
