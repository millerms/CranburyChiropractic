### Overview
Chiropractic care isn’t just for the spine. Joints in the **ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, and wrists** can limit movement and change how you feel. We assess the whole system and, when appropriate, use precise, hands-on adjustments for both spine **and** extremities.

### Why adjustments may help
Joints are packed with sensors (mechanoreceptors) that tell your brain how a joint is moving. When motion is restricted, those signals get “noisy,” which can feel like stiffness or discomfort. A gentle, quick adjustment can restore motion and often improves how your brain and muscles coordinate. We explain each step and only adjust when it fits your goals.

### When it may help
- Stiffness/tightness that limits **range of motion**  
- Discomfort that isn’t resolving with exercise alone  
- Returning to activity after sprains/strains (once it’s safe)  
- Feeling “off” with squats, steps, overhead reach, or grip

### What to expect
1. **Movement & joint screen** – we look at motion, comfort, and how areas influence each other  
2. **Adjustment (if appropriate)** – gentle positioning and a quick, controlled thrust  
3. **Add-ons as needed** – soft-tissue work or simple activation/mobility exercises  
4. **Home plan** – focused drills to keep gains between visits  
5. **Rechecks** – confirm progress and adjust the plan

### How we measure progress
- Range-of-motion and functional tasks (squat, step-down, overhead reach)  
- Comfort during daily activities and exercise  
- Strength/coordination changes with simple tests

### FAQs
**Is it safe?**  
Yes, adjustments are generally safe when used appropriately. We tailor each adjustment to your comfort and needs

**Will I always get adjusted?**  
No, we only adjust when it fits your goals. Some people prefer adjustments; others focus on exercise or soft-tissue work.

**What’s the “pop”?**  
The “pop” is a quick release of gas bubbles in the joint fluid, not bones cracking. It’s normal and often feels good, but not everyone experiences it.

Yes, we adjust extremity joints when appropriate. It’s not just about the spine.
