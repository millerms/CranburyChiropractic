## Overview
Diversified is a precise, hands-on adjustment. We position you comfortably, take up slack in a specific joint, and deliver a quick, controlled thrust to restore motion. We use it for the **spine** and, when appropriate, for **extremity joints** such as the ankle, knee, shoulder, or wrist. A brief pop is normal—that’s gas releasing inside the joint, like cracking a knuckle.

### When it may help
- Stiff or limited motion in a specific joint (neck, mid‑back, low back, rib, ankle, knee, shoulder, wrist), to help restore normal  sensory input and motion
- Discomfort that eases with movement but keeps returning
- Feeling “stuck,” guarded, or off during everyday tasks or sports
- After an injury, **once it’s safe** to do so

### Why it works
Joints are rich in mechanoreceptors that signal your brain about position and motion; restoring input often improves coordination and comfort. Diversified is widely used and not one-size-fits-all—we choose it when precise, joint-specific motion is the goal.

### When we choose something else
- You prefer to avoid thrust adjustments—totally fine
- There’s a medical reason to avoid them
- Another option is a better first step (joint mobilization, instrument-assisted work, soft-tissue, or targeted exercise)

### How we use it
- **As a primary treatment** for stiffness or discomfort in a specific joint
- **Alongside other care** like soft-tissue work, laser therapy, or shockwave
- **As part of a broader plan** that includes simple exercises to reinforce the change
- **When it fits your needs** and you’re comfortable with the approach

### What to expect
1. **Examine & explain** — thorough history, orthopedic, neurologic, and chiropractic exams; we discuss options and answer questions  
2. **Setup** — comfortable positioning and clear instructions so you know what to expect  
3. **Adjustment** — a quick, small-amplitude thrust to a specific joint; a pop may or may not occur  
4. **Recheck** — confirm changes in motion and comfort, and plan next steps

### How we measure progress
- Changes in **range of motion**, ease of movement, and decreases in pain levels
- Functional tasks you care about (reach, step, lift/turn) feel smoother
- Your report of **comfort and confidence** during daily tasks or sports
- Simple checks of control/coordination that match your goals
