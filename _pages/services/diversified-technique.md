### Overview
Diversified is a precise, hands‑on adjustment method. We position you comfortably, take slack out of a specific joint, and deliver a quick, controlled thrust to restore motion and reduce irritation. It can be used for the **spine** and, when appropriate, for **extremity joints** like the ankle, knee, shoulder, or wrist. Some people hear a brief pop—that’s just gas releasing inside the joint, not bones grinding.

### When it may help
- Stiff or limited motion in a specific joint (neck, mid‑back, low back, rib, ankle, knee, shoulder, wrist)
- Discomfort that eases with movement but keeps returning
- Feeling “stuck,” guarded, or off during everyday tasks or sport
- After an injury **once it’s safe** to do so, to help restore normal motion

### When we choose something else
- You prefer to avoid thrust adjustments—totally fine
- There’s a medical reason to avoid them
- A different option is a better first step (joint mobilization, instrument‑assisted work, soft‑tissue, or targeted exercise)

### How we use it
- **As a primary treatment** for stiffness or discomfort in a specific joint
- **Alongside other care** like soft-tissue work, laser therapy, or shockwave
- **As part of a broader plan** that includes simple drills to reinforce the change
- **When it fits your goals** and you’re comfortable with the approach

### What to expect
1. **Screen & explain** — history, movement, and joint tests; we discuss options and answer questions  
2. **Setup** — comfortable positioning and clear instructions so you know what to expect  
3. **Adjustment** — a quick, small‑amplitude thrust to a specific joint; a pop may or may not occur  
4. **Reinforce** — brief activation or mobility work so the change “sticks”  
5. **Recheck** — confirm changes in motion and comfort, and plan next steps

### How we measure progress
- Changes in **range of motion** and ease of movement
- Functional tasks you care about (reach, step, lift/turn) feel smoother
- Your report of **comfort and confidence** during daily tasks or sport
- Simple checks of control/coordination that match your goals
