### Overview
Feeling steady is a skill your nervous system learns and keeps. We look at three systems that drive balance:

- **Visual** (eyes) — where you are in space  
- **Vestibular** (inner ear) — head movement and position  
- **Proprioceptive** (joints/muscles) — body position feedback

When one system lags, you compensate. Our job is to find the limiter, match drills to it, and track progress.

### When it may help
- **Hesitation on stairs or curbs**, or avoiding uneven ground  
- **Fear of falling** or feeling “wobbly” when you close your eyes  
- Post-injury balance that **hasn’t felt the same**  
- You want more **confidence** for daily life or sport

### What to expect
1. **Short balance screen** — standing tests (eyes open/closed), head turns, single-leg stance  
2. **Balance tracker** — computerized scale that measures sway → **risk-of-fall score** you can see  
3. **Targeted plan** — gaze-stabilization, head/eye coordination, stance progressions (firm → foam), foot/ankle work  
4. **Right-sized homework** — brief micro-sets at home  
5. **Rechecks** — see changes in sway and confidence over time

### How we measure progress
- Tracker sway metrics and risk-of-fall trend  
- Functional wins: smoother turns, easier stairs, less drift  
- Timed stances (tandem, single-leg) and task tolerance

### FAQs
**Do I need to be athletic?**  
No—balance work is scaled to you at any age.

**Why isn’t “just strengthening” enough?**  
Strength helps, but balance is a brain–body skill. We train the limiting system, then layer strength.

**How quickly will I notice change?**  
Some feel improvements quickly; others build over weeks. We track what’s helping.

**Home plan?**  
Yes—short, clear routines you can actually do.

**Referral if needed?**  
Of course. We co-manage with PT/OT/ENT/neurology when that’s best.
