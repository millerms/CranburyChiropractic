## Overview
If you don’t feel steady, we’ll figure out why and make a simple plan to improve it. We look at three systems that drive balance:
{: .reveal .reveal--fade }

- **Visual** (eyes) — where you are in space  
- **Vestibular** (inner ear) — head movement and position  
- **Proprioceptive** (joints/muscles) — body position feedback

When one system lags, you compensate. We find the limiter, match exercises to it, and track progress you can see.

### When it may help
- **Hesitation on stairs or curbs**, or avoiding uneven ground  
- **Fear of falling** or feeling “wobbly” when you close your eyes  
- Post-injury balance that **hasn’t felt the same**  
- You want more **confidence** for daily life or sport
{: .reveal .reveal--up }

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** — standing tests (eyes open/closed), head turns, single‑leg stance  
2. **Tracker** — computerized balance score you can follow over time  
3. **Plan** — gaze stabilization, head/eye work, stance progressions, foot/ankle work  
4. **Home plan** — brief, right‑sized sets at home  
5. **Track** — see changes in sway and confidence over time

### How we measure progress
- Tracker sway metrics and risk-of-fall trend  
- Functional wins: smoother turns, easier stairs, less drift  
- Timed stances (tandem, single-leg) and task tolerance

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Why isn’t “just strengthening” enough?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Strength helps, but balance depends on how your brain processes input from your eyes, inner ear, and joints. We target the specific system that’s lagging so the whole pattern improves.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How quickly will I notice change?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
