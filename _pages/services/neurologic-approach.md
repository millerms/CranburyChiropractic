## Overview
This lens guides every visit. We check how your **eyes (visual)**, **inner ear (vestibular)**, and **joints/muscles (proprioception)** talk to your brain, then match care to the underlying cause we find—the mobility, control, or tissue-irritability pattern most holding you back. Cleaner sensory input paired with better joint motion helps your brain coordinate movement with less effort, so the plan stays practical and fits your day.

### What we assess
- Sensory input: how eyes, inner ear, and joint/muscle feedback agree—or do not
- Motor control: timing, coordination, and joint control under load
- Functional tasks: reach, rotate, stairs, gait—scaled to what you need
- Recovery factors: breathing mechanics and tolerance to effort/positions
- Context: your goals, history, and day-to-day demands

> For **balance-specific** testing, protocols, and our risk-of-fall score, see the companion page: [Balance & Stability]({{ '/services/balance-stability/' | relative_url }}).

### When we use it
- Recurring aches or strains that slip back after rest
- Neck or shoulder issues tied to headaches, eye strain, or jaw tension
- Low-back or hip problems driven by control more than raw strength
- Stiffness or balance concerns limiting daily tasks or confidence
- Post-injury phases when “it doesn’t feel normal yet,” even after clearance
{: .reveal .reveal--fade }

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** — quick eye, balance, and joint motion checks, plus simple functional tasks  
2. **Map the cause** — clarify whether input, output, or both are limiting progress  
3. **Plan** — chiropractic adjustments and targeted exercises as appropriate; add Class III laser or ESWT only if it fits  
4. **Home plan** — short, doable sets you can fit into your day  
5. **Track** — quick rechecks to confirm what’s helping and adjust as needed

### How we measure progress
- Functional wins you notice—easier stairs, steadier reach, smoother rotation
- Objective checks when useful—range, coordination timing, or task reps
- Your report of effort, confidence, and symptom change during daily life
- Tissue tolerance and range-of-motion rechecks that confirm durability

### Evidence snapshot
- Major back and neck pain guidelines recommend **non-pharmacologic care first**—education, exercise, and manual therapy when appropriate (ACP 2017; NICE NG59 2020). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28192789/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACP</a> · <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NICE NG59</a>
- **Vestibular rehabilitation** is effective and safe for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, which supports the balance and drills we recommend. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581507/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cochrane 2015</a>
- **Exercise protocols reduce falls** in community settings when balance and functional training are part of the plan (Sherrington 2020; Ng 2019). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31792067/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sherrington 2020</a> · <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31908838/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ng 2019</a>
- Combining **targeted exercise** with **manual therapy** is widely recommended for many musculoskeletal complaints, reinforcing our blended approach. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28192789/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACP 2017</a>

These themes shape every visit: we explain findings in plain language, layer in right-sized movement and manual care first, and coordinate imaging or referrals only when they would change the plan.

### Tools we may use
- Chiropractic adjustments when specific motion is limited
- Coordination work: sensory drills that sync vision, inner-ear input, and skeletal-driven feedback to address sensory mismatches
- Task-based exercise progressions with home “micro-sets” matched to your goals

### Safety and referrals
Your safety comes first. We screen for red flags, use imaging only when it would change the plan, and coordinate with other providers when needed (e.g., PT, orthopedics, neurology, or primary care).

### FAQs

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is this just for balance problems?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      No. We use the neurologic lens for many issues where timing, control, or input quality matter. For balance-only details, see <a href="{{ '/services/balance-stability/' | relative_url }}">Balance &amp; Stability</a>.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Do you still adjust?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes, when it fits your needs. Adjustments are one tool in our toolkit, used alongside exercises and other techniques.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is there a home plan?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes, we give you brief, clear routines that fit your schedule. No long workouts or complex exercises.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How quickly will I notice change?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Some feel improvements quickly; others build over weeks. We track what’s helping and adjust as needed.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What if I need another provider?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      We’ll tell you if another specialist is a better fit and help coordinate care. Our goal is to get you the right help, not just keep you coming back.
