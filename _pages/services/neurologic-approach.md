## Overview
This is the lens we use for all care. We’ll check how your **eyes (visual)**, **inner ear (vestibular)**, and **joints/muscles (proprioception)** talk to your brain, then match care to the limiter we find. You get a plan that feels practical and fits your day.

Clearer sensory input and better joint motion help your brain coordinate movement with less effort.

### What we assess
- Sensory input: eyes, inner ear, and joint/muscle feedback
- Motor control: timing, coordination, and joint control under load
- Functional tasks: reach, rotate, stairs, gait—scaled to you
- Recovery factors: breath mechanics and tolerance to effort/positions
- Your goals and history: we tailor the plan to your life

> For **balance-specific** testing, protocols, and our risk-of-fall score, see the companion page: [Balance & Stability]({{ '/services/balance-stability/' | relative_url }}).

### When we use it
- Recurring aches or strains that slip back after rest
- Neck/shoulder issues with headaches or eye fatigue
- Low back/hip problems tied to control more than strength
- Stiffness or balance concerns that limit daily tasks
- After injury when it “doesn’t feel normal yet”
{: .reveal .reveal--fade }

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** — brief eye, head/eye, and joint motion checks, plus simple functional tasks  
2. **Map the limiter** — clarify if input, output, or both are limiting progress  
3. **Plan** — targeted exercises and joint work when appropriate; add Class III laser or ESWT if useful  
4. **Home plan** — short, doable sets you can fit into your day  
5. **Track** — quick rechecks to confirm what’s helping and adjust as needed

### How we measure progress
- Functional tests you feel (easier stairs, steadier reach, smoother rotation)
- Objective checks when helpful (range, coordination timing, task reps)
- Your report of effort and confidence during daily tasks or sport
- Changes in pain/irritation during activity and rest
- Tissue tolerance and range-of-motion rechecks

### Evidence snapshot
- Clinical guidelines for back and neck pain consistently recommend non‑pharmacologic care—education, exercise, and manual therapy—as first‑line options.
- Research on sensorimotor (visual/vestibular/proprioceptive) training suggests it can improve balance, motor control, and comfort in many people.
- Balance programs reduce fall risk in older adults; we quantify steadiness with a computerized balance score you can track over time.
- Combining manual therapy with targeted exercises is often more helpful than either alone for many musculoskeletal complaints.

### Tools we may use
- Joint work (mobilization/adjustment) when specific motion is limited
- Coordination work: eye–head drills, gaze stabilization, tempo/isometrics
- Task‑based exercise progressions matched to your goals
- Home “micro‑sets” you can fit into your day

### Safety and referrals
Your safety comes first. We screen for red flags, use imaging only when it would change the plan, and coordinate with other providers when needed (e.g., PT, orthopedics, neurology, or primary care).

### FAQs

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is this just for balance problems?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      No. We use the neurologic lens for many issues where timing, control, or input quality matter. For balance-only details, see <a href="{{ '/services/balance-stability/' | relative_url }}">Balance &amp; Stability</a>.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Do you still adjust?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes, when it fits your goals. Adjustments are one tool in our toolkit, used alongside exercises and other techniques.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is there a home plan?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes, we give you brief, clear routines that fit your schedule. No long workouts or complex exercises.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How quickly will I notice change?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Some feel improvements quickly; others build over weeks. We track what’s helping and adjust as needed.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What if I need another provider?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      We’ll tell you if another specialist is a better fit and help coordinate care. Our goal is to get you the right help, not just keep you coming back.
