### Overview
Your nervous system is the “operating system” for movement, comfort, and control. When the brain receives **clear input** (from eyes, inner ear, and joints/muscles) and sends **coordinated output** (timing, strength, and stability), you move well and feel confident. When signals are **noisy**—after injury, stress, illness, or just lack of practice—your body compensates. That can show up as stiffness, recurring strains, fatigue with simple tasks, or trouble coordinating movement.

Our neurologic approach is a practical way to find the **limiter** in your system and match treatment to it. We use this lens across all care, whether it’s balance work, adjustments, laser therapy, or shockwave therapy. The goal is to help you move better, recover faster, and stay active.

### What we assess
- **Sensory input**
  - **Visual**: eye movements, tracking, convergence
  - **Vestibular (inner ear)**: head-motion tolerance, head/eye coordination
  - **Proprioceptive**: feedback from joints, muscles, and spine
- **Motor output**
  - Timing/coordination, movement patterns, joint control under load
  - “Control before strength” — can you *organize* the movement you’re asking for?
- **Autonomic factors**
  - Recovery, breath mechanics, tolerance to effort or position changes
- **Functional tasks**
  - Gait, step-downs, reach/rotate, lift/carry — scaled to your goals

> For **balance-specific** testing, protocols, and our risk-of-fall score, see the companion page: [Balance & Stability]({{ '/services/balance-stability/' | relative_url }}).

### When this approach may help
- **Recurrent aches/strains** that return after rest
- **Neck/shoulder** issues with headaches or eye fatigue
- **Low back/hip** problems tied to control, not just strength
- Feeling “**off**” when you squat, step down, reach overhead, or stabilize the trunk
- Post-injury “**doesn’t feel normal yet**” despite basic rehab
- Coordination or pacing issues during sport or everyday tasks

### What to expect
1. **Screen** — short sensorimotor checks (eyes, head/eye, joint motion), coordination drills, and functional tasks  
2. **Map the limiter** — is the bottleneck **input**, **output**, or **both**?  
3. **Plan** — targeted drills (eye-head work, patterning, tempo/isometrics), joint work/adjustments when appropriate, and simple strength to “set” the change  
4. **Right-sized homework** — brief “micro-sets” you can fit into your day  
5. **Rechecks** — confirm changes with quick measures so you know what’s helping

### How we measure progress
- Functional tests you feel (easier stairs, steadier reach, smoother rotation)
- Objective checks when helpful (range, coordination timing, task reps)
- Your report of effort and confidence during daily tasks or sport

### FAQs
**Is this just for balance problems?**  
No. We use the neurologic lens for many issues where timing, control, or input quality matter. For balance-only details, see [Balance & Stability]({{ '/services/balance-stability/' | relative_url }}).

**Do you still adjust?**  
Yes—when it fits your goals and the screen. We pair adjustments with drills or exercise so changes last.

**Is there a home plan?**  
Always. Short, clear micro-sets you can actually do.

**What if I need another provider?**  
We’ll say so and help coordinate care (PT/OT, orthopedics, ENT/neurology) when that’s the better next step.
