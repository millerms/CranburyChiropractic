## Overview
Shockwave therapy (ESWT) delivers **pulsed acoustic energy** to a precise area to nudge a stalled tissue back into a healing pattern. It’s most often used when a problem hasn’t responded to rest or routine care and works best when paired with a simple, progressive loading plan.

### How it works
The acoustic pulses create a small, controlled mechanical stimulus that can **increase local blood flow**, **modulate pain signaling**, and **trigger a “repair” response** in the tissue. Sessions are brief and intensity is adjusted to your comfort.

### Why we use it
ESWT is most consistently helpful for **plantar fasciitis** and **mid‑portion Achilles tendinopathy**. It can also be considered for other stubborn tendon or enthesis issues (e.g., lateral elbow, greater‑trochanter/hip) when exam findings fit. It’s **not** a replacement for active care—we use it to support progress alongside targeted exercises.

### When we use it
- **Plantar fasciitis** (heel pain)
- **Mid‑portion Achilles tendinopathy**
- Lateral epicondyle (“tennis elbow”) and other persistent tendon/enthesis complaints
- **Stubborn spots** that haven’t improved with rest or routine care
- When you prefer a non‑invasive option before considering injections or surgery

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** — confirm ESWT is a good fit for your case  
2. **Treatment** — a tapping/pulsing sensation for a few minutes; intensity is matched to comfort  
3. **Series** — many people do best with **3–6 sessions**, usually spaced **about a week apart**  
4. **Pair with activity** — we combine ESWT with a short list of exercises so the change “sticks”  
5. **Aftercare** — mild soreness or redness is possible for 24–48 hours; we’ll give simple do’s and don’ts  
6. **Track** — quick rechecks guide any adjustments to the plan

### How we measure progress
- Pain/irritation changes during daily tasks  
- Function: walking tolerance, stairs, grip, reach  
- Tissue tolerance and range‑of‑motion rechecks

### FAQs

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is it safe? Will it hurt?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      ESWT is generally safe when used appropriately. Most people feel a tapping or pulsing sensation; we adjust intensity to your comfort. Mild soreness or redness afterward is common and typically short‑lived.
    </div>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is there research to support it?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes. ESWT shows the strongest, most consistent benefit for <strong>plantar fasciitis</strong> and <strong>mid‑portion Achilles tendinopathy</strong>. Outcomes vary by condition and treatment settings, which is why we pair ESWT with an active plan. A few examples:

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How many sessions will I need?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      It varies by condition, but a short series (often <strong>3–6 sessions</strong>) is common. We reassess each visit and adjust as needed.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Can I combine it with other care?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes — ESWT pairs well with adjustments, manual therapy, and a simple loading plan. That combination is often what makes results last.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Does it replace exercise?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      No. ESWT is an add‑on to active care. We’ll give you brief, targeted drills so improvements carry over into daily life.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Who shouldn’t have ESWT?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      ESWT isn’t used over bone growth plates, active infection, tumors, or in pregnancy over the abdomen/pelvis. People with bleeding disorders or on certain blood thinners may not be candidates. We screen for safety first.
    </div>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What if I need a referral?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      We’ll coordinate with the right specialist (PT, orthopedics, etc.) if needed. The goal is the best result for you.
