### Overview
Shockwave therapy (ESWT) uses **pulsed acoustic waves** on stubborn, localized problem areas. The waves create a small, controlled mechanical stimulus that can encourage your body’s normal repair responses. We often use ESWT when a spot hasn’t responded to rest or routine care.

### How it works
The pulsed waves create tiny mechanical stresses that may increase local circulation, influence tissue signaling, and help reorganize irritated tissue. Sessions are brief and intensity is adjusted to your comfort.

### Why it may help
ESWT is often used for persistent spots that haven’t responded to other treatments. It’s not a replacement for active care, but it can be a useful tool to help you get back on track.

### When it may help
- **Plantar fasciitis** (heel pain)  
- **Trigger finger** (stiffness/locking)  
- Persistent tendon/enthesis complaints (e.g., elbow, shoulder, hip)
- **Stubborn spots** that haven’t improved with rest or routine care
- When you prefer a non-invasive option before considering injections or surgery

### What to expect
1. **Quick screen** – confirm ESWT is a good fit  
2. **Treatment** – tapping/pulsing sensation for a few minutes  
3. **Series** – many people do best with **3–6 sessions**  
4. **Pair with activity** – we often combine ESWT with exercise and mobility work
5. **Rechecks** – confirm changes and adjust the plan as needed

### How we measure progress
- Pain/irritation changes during daily tasks  
- Function: walking tolerance, stairs, grip, reach  
- Tissue tolerance and range-of-motion rechecks
