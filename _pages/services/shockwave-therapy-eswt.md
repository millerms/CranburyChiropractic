## Overview
Shockwave therapy (ESWT) delivers **pulsed acoustic energy** to a precise area to nudge a stalled tissue back into a healing pattern. It’s most often used when a problem hasn’t responded to rest or routine care and works best when layered onto a neurologically informed chiropractic plan.

### How it works
The acoustic pulses create a small, controlled mechanical stimulus that can **increase local blood flow**, **modulate pain signaling**, and **trigger a “repair” response** in the tissue. Sessions are brief, and we match intensity to your comfort.

### Why we use it
ESWT is most consistently helpful for **upper and lower extremity tendon, fascial, and soft-tissue issues**. It’s often considered for other stubborn tendon problems (e.g., tennis elbow) when exam findings fit. It’s **not** a replacement for adjustments or active care—we use it to calm irritated tissue so the sensory signals feeding your brain clear up and motor control carries over between visits.

### When we use it
- **Plantar fasciitis** (heel pain)
- **Upper and lower extremity tendinopathy**
- **Lateral epicondyle** (“tennis elbow”) and other persistent tendon/enthesis complaints
- **Stubborn spots** that haven’t improved with rest or routine care
- When you prefer a non‑invasive option before considering injections or surgery

### What to expect
1. **Evaluate** — confirm ESWT is a good fit for your case  
2. **Treatment** — a tapping/pulsing sensation for a few minutes; intensity is matched to comfort  
3. **Series** — many people do best with **3–10 sessions**  
4. **Pair with chiropractic care and exercises** — we combine ESWT with adjustments and a short list of exercises so neurologic gains “stick”  
5. **Track** — quick rechecks guide any adjustments to the plan

### How we measure progress
- Pain/irritation changes during daily tasks  
- Function: walking tolerance (minutes or step count), stairs, grip strength, reach distance  
- Tissue tolerance and range‑of‑motion rechecks

### FAQs

<div class="faq">
  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is it safe? Will it hurt?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      ESWT is generally safe when used appropriately. Most people feel a tapping or pulsing sensation; we adjust intensity to your comfort. Mild soreness or redness afterward is common and typically short‑lived.

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Is there research to support it?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes. ESWT shows the strongest, most consistent benefit for <strong>plantar fasciitis</strong> and <strong>tendinopathy</strong>. Outcomes vary by condition and treatment settings, which is why we pair ESWT with a treatment plan. A few examples:

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>How many sessions will I need?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      It varies by condition, but a short series (often <strong>3–10 sessions</strong>) is common. We reassess each visit and adjust as needed.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Can I combine it with other care?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      Yes — ESWT pairs well with adjustments, manual therapy, and a simple loading plan. That combination is often what makes results last.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>Who shouldn’t have ESWT?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      ESWT isn’t used over bone growth plates, active infection, tumors, or in pregnancy over the abdomen/pelvis. People with bleeding disorders or on certain blood thinners may not be candidates. We screen for safety first.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="reveal reveal--up">
    <summary>What if I need a referral?</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      We’ll refer you to the right specialist (PT, orthopedics, etc.) if needed. The goal is the best result for you.
