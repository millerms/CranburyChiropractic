### Overview
Shockwave therapy (ESWT) uses **pulsed acoustic waves** on stubborn, localized problem areas. The waves create a small, controlled mechanical stimulus that can encourage your body’s normal repair responses. We often use ESWT when a spot hasn’t responded to rest or routine care.

### How it works
The pulsed waves create tiny mechanical stresses that may increase local circulation, influence tissue signaling, and help reorganize irritated tissue. Sessions are brief and intensity is adjusted to your comfort.

### When it may help
- **Plantar fasciitis** (heel pain)  
- **Trigger finger** (stiffness/locking)  
- Persistent tendon/enthesis complaints (e.g., elbow, shoulder, hip)

### What to expect
1. **Quick screen** – confirm ESWT is a good fit  
2. **Treatment** – tapping/pulsing sensation for a few minutes  
3. **Series** – many people do best with **3–6 sessions**  
4. **Pair with activity** – we often combine ESWT with exercise and mobility work

### How we measure progress
- Pain/irritation changes during daily tasks  
- Function: walking tolerance, stairs, grip, reach  
- Tissue tolerance and range-of-motion rechecks

> We’ll tell you if ESWT isn’t appropriate or if another provider is the better next step.

### FAQs
**Is it safe? Will it hurt?**  
Used appropriately, yes, and we adjust intensity to your tolerance. Most describe a tapping or pressure sensation.

**How many sessions will I need?**  
Commonly 3–6, but it depends on your goals and response.

**Can I combine it with other care?**  
Yes—often paired with adjustments, exercise, or soft-tissue work.

**Does it replace exercise?**  
No. We build an active plan so changes “stick.”

**What if I need a referral?**  
We’ll coordinate with the right specialist when needed.
